<h2 align="middle">Accomplishments So Far</h2>
<!-- summarize what you have accomplished
-->
<p>
  We are trying to realistically simulate liquids in this project using the Langrangian method. 
  This is important as we want to be able to generate fluids with realistic motion for use in 
  software such as movies and games. In general,we are going to try to solve this problem by 
  using Project 4’s renderer to model liquid particle motion by implementing the physics for 
  collisions similar to how we did for project 4. We will also try to implement smooth particle 
  hydrodynamics.
